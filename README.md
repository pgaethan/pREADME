# **Introduction**
     Jobs4Youth is a work program established in an effort to break the "school to prison" pipeline that is becoming prevalent in our culture. This is done by a five stage program that equips participants in gaining educational and vocational credentials as well as job training as they progress.

# **System Overview**
     The website layout and structure should be intuitive and clarify exactly who can get involved and they can help the program. The visual aesthetic and the design of the website has to match with the goal of the program and the targeted audience.

* ## **Technologies Used**
       To implement the website, we use Balsamic Wireframes, version 4.0.24, the free online Mocklow Mockup Maker, and the Adobe Suite to write down codes.

* ## **Assumptions and Constraints**
       we thought that we just need wordbPress to built our website, but, later, we have learned about other tools to create wireframes and mockup pages. We could not host the website due to lack of time since we could not meet in person.

# **Project Focus**
* Background information on the issue.
* Information about background of story and how the program .information get started.
* External resources that provide information on the problem and related issues.
* Clear steps on how to help/ get involved(e.g. donations or services)

# **Test Approach**
* Validation Testing
    Ran each page through HTML validator plugin
* Link testing -  all page buttons and links were tested to ensure proper internet and external navigation.
* Usability
* Accessibility Testing
    * Reasonable site loading time
    * Easy to read font size and spacing between lines
    * Proper ALT Tags for all images
* Content Testing
    * Clear and descriptive headings
    * consistent font styles and colons and colors. It helps the users to understand they're still on your site.
    * User-friendly and meaningful keywords for URLs. It helps both the users and search engine bots to understand navigation.
    * Meaningful and self-explanatory titles(in the \<TITLE> tag). Search engines use these tags to display the pages in the search results.
* Compatibility Testing
    * The site was tested accross multiple browsers and device types in order to ensure widespread compatibility.
